Problem Definition
==================

The Problem Defintion is an object that houses all information about the optimization problem being solved.
The user must edit this file directly in order to change any of th attributes. Then upon running the algorithm, the 
problem definiton should be intialized and passed to the ADAM_control_module. 

The information housed in the Problem Definition is separated into the following subsections:

* ADAM Gradient Descent runtime parameters
* System geometry and materials
* Objective & Transformation Funtions

The following secitons will cover each of these in detail.
